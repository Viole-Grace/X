The pauper's CamScanner

CamScanner is [one of the apps that has been banned in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/india-bans-59-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-helo-wechat/articleshow/76694814.cms) following skirmishes between India and China.

It is an amazing App with a lot of practical uses - and so we decided to make our own version of CamScanner!

## To Run and try this, clone the repository:

$git clone https://github.com/Viole-Grace/X

- Run the scanner.py file
$python3 scanner.py

- To run with another image / try it on other images, change 'filename' in scanner.py --> calling_card()
